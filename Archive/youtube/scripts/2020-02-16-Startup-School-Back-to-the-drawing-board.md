In January started a new round of YC Startup School. The timing couldn't be better because I work on my own project, and I welcome any advice which will help me to make it real! What are my thoughts about Startup School after several weeks?

I've got an idea for my project when I did my research on YouTube. One day I went to a webinar hosted by Sean Cannel. He already has a successful YouTube career; just recently, he passed one million subscribers. However, as he told us, most of his income doesn't come out of YouTube but from selling digital products, especially courses. The key is to market them by yourself, which is harder, but the potential earnings are higher. If you sell your courses on a digital marketplace like Udemy, you're competing with other instructors with similar content. It will create pressure on prices.

Let's say you've made a new Flutter course, and it's high quality. One day later, some student searches for Flutter on Udemy, and your listing is among ten others. Eight of them are ranked above 4 stars; however, your class costs 50 dollars, and other instructors sell theirs between 10 to 20 dollars. Do you think that this student will buy your course? I seriously doubt it.

On the other hand, if you have all your courses on your website, you have to market them by yourself. To do that, you need first to build your brand and trust. Then you can sell your products for much higher prices than on Udemy. The content on your website is yours, you're not competing with anyone. To bring people to your web, you could host a free webinar on your YouTube channel or promote your courses through your social channels.

It was a revelation for me. There's a vast potential market of content creators who produce digital courses and want to publish them on their websites. They need a platform to host the content. Also, they need detailed analytics, integrated payments, manage their mailing lists. Instructors should also have a way to generate discounts and provide affiliate links. With this idea, I applied to Startup School, and I called my company Comenio.

I planned to work on my minimum viable product for the whole year of 2020, part-time in the evenings. However, the first week of Startup School made me re-think. As it turned out, I understood the notion of MVP wrong. I thought that my first product should be limited in functionality but otherwise fully functional. How can I persuade people to pay for my product if it's crude and lacks features? As it turns out, I'm not the only one with such thoughts. Here comes the revelation. If you hit an actual problem which nobody solved before you people will gladly pay for your product. If they don't, maybe you need to target your product to different users or shift the idea in a new direction. This is the point where I'm stuck now. As I did my research, I found a few other companies with products very similar to mine. They're not perfect, but they're miles ahead of me. I can't compete if I don't offer something unique to users. Something they're desperate for.

After four weeks of Startup School, I could sum up all the talks into just a few basic concepts. Talk to users about their problems and try to get insights. Come up with a product that will solve their most crucial issues. Cut down features to a minimum and build your MVP. Get some first users and collect feedback. If they leave, figure out why? Building a startup is an iterative process, and as it turns out, you're relying on data and user insights more than on your intuition. It's something I still need to absorb.

At the moment, I'm trying to get more insight from users. The problem is, however, that I don't know where to find them. My original intention was to target the US market. Well, Startup School also offers video group sessions where you could discuss your problems with other founders. I've got some useful hints in which direction I should go. I will definitely look into it.

Startup School is a great initiative. They give so much and ask for almost nothing. I will definitely join the course again in the future. And if you think of bringing a new, innovative product, you should try this too.
