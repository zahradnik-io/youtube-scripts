My first encounter with Google products was around 1998. Back then we've got dial-up internet access. It was painfully slow, but at least it worked. One of the first webpages I ever saw was Google's search engine. At the time, Google already had strong position among search engines, but it's overall ecosystem was not yet built.

A few years later, in 2004, when I was at high school, a classmate of mine asked if I'd like to try [Gmail][gmail]. When Gmail arrived, it was [invitation-only][gmail-history] and was flagged beta, which was visible in it's logo for years to come. Also it offered 1 GB storage space for emails, which seemed to be limitless back then.
Firstly I declined his offer, I already had an email account elsewhere and I saw no benefits in ditching my old email in favor of Gmail. Later I changed my mind and decided to try it out of curiosity. Gmail interface was very simple, but efficient. It also integrated [Google Talk][google-talk] for instant messaging communication, which supported [XMPP][xmpp] protocol. This allowed me to use alternative clients to communicate with Gmail users. A feature which I happily used for years.

As time passed, Google gradually built its ecosystem. They introduced Google Drive, Calendar, Contacts, Photos, Maps. Google also acquired YouTube and experimented with their own social network, Google Plus, which I believe had many great features, but was used by almost no one. You could use all these services with your Gmail account, which was very convinient. One account to [rule them all][sauron].

First inconvenience came, when Google replaced Talk with [Hangouts][google-hangouts] and dropped support for XMPP, which cut off alternative messaging clients. Hangouts used Google's proprietary protocol instead. Later, Google restricted YouTube comments [only for Google Plus accounts][youtube-google-plus]. A step, which was later took back after massive negative throwback. And lastly, there's Google's liking in [discontinuing their services][google-discontinued-services], which end up in [Google Graveyard][google-graveyard]. To sum up, you're stuck in a ecosystem, which is rapidly changing, not always in a positive way, and you have no guarantees that the service you're happily using will exist in a year to come.

In 2014, Google introduced [Inbox by Gmail][inbox-by-gmail], which was similarly to how Gmail started, invitation only. And luckily I've got an invite from a colleague of mine. Inbox offered alternative view on all your emails. Inbox was an idea of Google, how an email client of the future should look like. It used machine learning for categorizing incoming mail, creating calendar events out of received emails, and had different workflow. Overall, it was much more productive tool for me. By the time I received several dozens of emails every day and Inbox allowed me to focus only on the relevant and get rid of the rest quickly. I almost forgot that Gmail even exists and used Inbox exclusively. Later I even installed a Chrome extension to easily store webpage links inside Inbox. I didn't use browser bookmarks anymore. These links appear in your Inbox as regular emails.

Few days ago I received a notification inside Inbox, telling me that Inbox will be discontinued by the end of [March 2019][inbox-discontinued]. Google just asked me nicely to use Gmail instead. Gmail implemented some of the features from Inbox, but is still lacking many more. And my saved weblinks are not visible from Gmail. By now I have hundreds of links moved into different categories to be easily found.

What started for me as a simple email service many years ago, is now an ubiquitous account, on which I am dependant. Remember when I told you that Gmail had originally 1 GB storage, which seemd to be limitless? Now all my emails have around 3.7 GB, I use Google Drive, Photos and Calendar and my phone runs Android. I realized my dependency on Google for a longer time, but I really liked Inbox. Shutting Inbox down was the last straw for me and I decided to take control of my own data.

Google's motto is ["Don't be evil"][google-motto]. Maybe the original idea was honest, but for me, Google is nowadays one giant corporation and it's difficult to trust this entity without doubt, especially because I have no idea how the decisions are made inside the company. But the internet is still mostly uncensored nowadays. I read posts from former Google employees, I also read leaked emails of internal communications regarding James Damore's [memo][damore-memo] and lastly I briefly read about the company's stance on free speech, which we know about from leaked memo called ["The Good Censor"][the-good-censor]. Then there's voice telling me, that YouTube is censoring conservative views, shadow banning videos from being shown in my feed etc. This is not a political post, I just wanted to make a point, that some of the events around Google seem to be disturbing to me.
