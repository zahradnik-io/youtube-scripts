I work as a software developer and I *love* what I do for a living. Getting paid for solving everyday puzzles and having the power to shape the future for millions of people never gets old.

However being good at writing the code will get you only to a certain point in your career. I realized that if you want to get further you need to *learn* how to spread your thoughts to other people. Giving speeches and writing blog posts is a very efficient way to meet this goal, if you do it *right*.

Recently I came to a conclusion that having such skills is far more important than learning a new programming language or framework. And it stands for almost any profession. Did I get your attention? Great! It's never too late to give your first speech. All you need is determination and [persistence][the-founder-persistence], as [Ray Kroc][ray-kroc-wiki] would say.

> Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan press on has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.

## The Past
I remember the day when I first discovered [MIT Open Courseware][mit-ocw] back in 2011. Suddenly I had the ability to watch the same lectures as the MIT students. Sure, being there in person is better, but still I was given an opportunity to learn from the best and most notably to learn whatever I want to. When the [edX platform][edx] started in 2012, I was one of the first registered members, eager to learn. Ultimately learning platforms such as [edX][edx] had more influence on my future career than my university degree.

### Knowledge kept only to myself
Throughout the years I gained knowledge on various subjects. The problem was that I was not able to apply *all* of the knowledge in my current job. Every job has a limited scope of what you should know. People call it *specialization*. As a result, when I worked as an Android developer, my performance was evaluated solely on my source code. I felt like I stagnated on the same place even if I constantly worked on myself. People didn't know about my potential and I had no way of telling them about it. Maybe that's the point when I realized that I *should* focus more on presentation skills. But how do you start?


### Community meetups
First IT community meetups in my city happened only about 4 or 5 years ago. I liked the idea of meeting likely-minded IT professionals very much. And I found a few good friends among them. If you're not familiar with meetups, here's the gist. Someone from the community prepares a speech for some topic and presents it to the audience. After (and sometimes during) the talk we ask questions and the whole event is concluded with informal networking, where you discuss pretty much anything.
