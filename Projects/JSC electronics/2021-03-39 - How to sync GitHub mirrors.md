Hey guys, VladimÃ­r here with JSC electronics. We work on various embedded projects, mostly Arduino. Check out our GitHub page. Link's in the description below.

- What are git mirrors and why do we need them?
- What was my motivation? Syncing Comenio repos...

- Existing solutions
  - GitLab Community mirroring - community version supports only pushing changes, not pulling. In this case, GitLab is your main source of truth.
    > B-roll - show GitHub Community page for mirroring
  - gitlab-mirror-pull
    - https://github.com/ochorocho/gitlab-mirror-pull
    - Unmaintained for over 3 years
    - Docker image
    - I was not able to set this up
    - Runs on the server. You can set up cron job
    > B-roll - show gitlab-mirror-pull GitHub page

  - gitlab-mirrors
    - https://github.com/samrocketman/gitlab-mirrors
    - Unmaintained for over 3 years
    - Written in Python 2
    - Runs locally on your PC. I was not able to set it up.
	> B-roll - show gitlab-mirrors GitHub page

- My solution
  - Simple bash script
  - Hierarchical structure of git repos I want to sync
  - On each level there's a sync script

- Limitations
  - Not triggered automatically
  - Need to set up manually
  - Only the branches you specify are synced

- Pros
  - Universal solution
  - Low software requirements - bash and git only
  - Ability to simply transfer all repos to another PC
