# A laptop powered by your phone? Meet NexDock

## Hook
I... have a dream. A long-lasting dream to use my mobile phone as a Linux laptop. So wherever I go, I can just plug my phone into a dock, and have all my work with me all the time. I don't want to use multiple devices. With projects like UBPorts (B-roll show UBPorts demo), my dream is slowly becoming a reality, but there's a long way ahead to materialize my dream. Today, I'll show you NexDock (B-roll show detail on my NexDock), which is a laptop powered by a smartphone or Raspberry Pi.

- How can I use my phone as a laptop?
  - Companies like Microsoft and Canonical worked on convergence for a long time. So when you plug your phone to a bigger screen, it will transfer into desktop.
  - In 2015, I bought Lumia 950. It was a phone from Microsoft, which had a dock into which you could plug your external display, keyboard, and mouse, and which offered desktop Windows experience. However, the experience was not very good
  - Canonical, the creator of Ubuntu, had similar vision. They wanted to adapt Ubuntu to mobile phones, and to turn them into fully usable computers when connected to dock. Ultimately, they abandoned the idea, but the project still lives thanks to community and the UBPorts project. And there are other groups with similar effort.
  - All modern Android smartphones are capable of HDMI output through their USB-C ports.
  - In 2018, 3-years later after Lumia 950 was released, Samsung came with their solution called DeX. For the original version you had to buy custom accessories, later a simple USB-C to HDMI adapter was enough. For quite some time, Samsung event provided a way how to run Linux on your phones. Sadly, their solution was abandoned in October 2015.
  - Samsung DeX was bound only to Samsung devices. However Android 10 came with a hidden desktop mode, which allowed to run desktop-like experience on some other devices. This mode was highly experimental, but hopefully it will get polished in upcoming Android devices, and become widely available on all modern smartphones.

- How does NexDock fit in?
  - And here we come to NexDock. It's just a display with a keyboard, touchpad, and its own battery. All this is packed in an aluminum chasis reminding of ultrabook laptops.
  - My phone, OnePlus 6T, doesn't support HDMI output, but NexDock supports also Raspberry Pi minicomputers, which I have plenty.

- NexDock is not perfect
  - I wanted to use my NexDock also as a secondary monitor, which I can hook up with my digital camera
    - HDMI port is picky and I got some usable output only once. Also, you can't use volume controls when only HDMI is used
  - The microHDMI to HDMI adapter is bad quality. It got broken after a couple of uses. Luckily, these adapters are cheap and easy to find.

There you have it guys. At the moment I use NexDock mostly with my Raspberry Pi computers when I do some embedded programming. It is quicker than hooking my Raspberry to my main display, keyboard and mouse, which are hooked to my desktop PC. I like that the build is decent quality, with a fullHD touch display. So in theory I can use NexDock for years, I will just switch to a different device I hook into it.

What do you think about convergence? Does it make sense for you to use your phone instead of your laptop? Let me know in the comments below. Thanks, and see you in the next video.
