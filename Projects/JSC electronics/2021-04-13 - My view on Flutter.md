# My view on Flutter

## Hook
Hey guys, this is Vladim√≠r with JSC electronics. Today I will take a closer look at Flutter. I'll explain what it is, how I got to this technology, where I think it's aiming, and why I believe Flutter will play a key role in multiplatform app development. If you haven't heard about this technology, maybe it's time to change it.

## Content
- How I got to Flutter
  - I first heard about Flutter 3 years ago
  - Insider info that Google works on a mysterious OS to replace Android
  - Android is well. Fuchsia apps are written in Flutter.

- What is Flutter?
  - Imagine you want to write an app running on Android and iOS
  - Native development - Android Studio/Kotlin and Xcode/Swift
  - App developed twice; not much of an overlap. Icon sharing perhaps?
  - Two teams. Waste of time and money.
  - Flutter solves this problem: Write once, run everywhere
  - Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, and web

- How Flutter works?
  - Show a typical mobile app - main window, screens, dialogs, context menus...
  - Imagine a white canvas into which you put your UI components
  - UI components = widgets
  - Great UX experience; users often can't tell the difference between Flutter and native apps
  - Saving money by choosing an appropriate technology

- Adeon Flutter Experiment
  - Available only on Android; nobody developed an iOS version. We lacked the resources to continue in development
  - Started developing Adeon on Flutter as an experiment
  - Flutter was inmature. Working with it wasn't pleasant. Localization issue
  - Our app run on iOS without much trouble
  - Hot Reload
  - Adeon Flutter updated to latest Flutter version
  - Many issues were fixed and now it works perfectly

- Flutter Documentation
  - Always well-written; best resource to learn the technology
  - You can always take a look at the code. It's open-source
  - Many example apps

- Codelabs
  - Step-by-step guides to build real-world applications

- Summary
  - Good ecosystem; pleasure to work with
  - Well-documented
  - Many examples and howto guides (codelabs)
  - Many online courses sponsored by Google, e.g., on Udacity
  - Other courses from independant instructors, e.g., on Udemy
  - YouTube videos

- My experience with Flutter now
  - After one week I find it easy to use
  - You don't deal with hassles of native app development
  - Building widget hierarchies is enough
  - I believe you can learn Flutter within two weeks

- Flutter app size - waste of phone resources?
  - Wasting development time and money is worse
  - Framework which allows re-using is therefore better

- Flutter went a long way in the past year, year and a half
  - Apps are now production-ready

- Moving Adeon into Flutter
  - More videos to come as I go
