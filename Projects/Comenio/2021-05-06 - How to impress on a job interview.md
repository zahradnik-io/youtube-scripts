# How to impress on a job interview

## Hook
During the years, I went through several job interviews, and I got an offer from the client most of the time. In this video I'll share my experience with handling job interviews.

## Content
- My background
  - Software Engineer
  - Went through several different jobs in my career
  - In december 2018 I became an entrepreneur
  - I cooperate with JSC electronics, which allowed me to work on many different projects. I rapidly gained diverse experience in many areas, especially with Arduino/RPi/Android integration
  - I started actively contributing to open-source
- Preparation
  - Your LinkedIn profile helps a lot
  - Tailor your CV to stand out among others
  - I bought a premium 1-month membership on Kickresume, just to create a CV with professional template. Something that just pops out among other bleek CVs
  - I always tailor my CV to the specific client. When I apply for a position of an Android developer, I mention mostly this experience
  - You should not put everything into your CV. However, if you're just starting, then write everything useful you can. And the motivation letter might also help
  - I always try to gather information about the client and the position. If for example I apply for a position of a Flutter developer, I should have basic knowledge about the technology
- Interview
  - Always be confident
  - You're selling yourself
  - Do not overexaggerate. Tell frankly what you know. What is your experience. But NEVER lie to the client.
  - Answer all the questions honestly. Also, ask questions to your client. It shows interest from your side.
  - Consider an interview as an opportunity to learn something new. You can ask about interesting technologies, or ask for opinions.
  - Take this as if you were talking with your friends about something. Don't think that much about the job interview
  - The key is to stay natural. If you don't get the job, it's not the end of the world.
 - Open-source activity helps a lot
   - You have something to show off
   - You can talk about your projects and anyone can see your work
   - You can contribute to open-source even if you're not a developer. I will prepare a separate video to cover this.
 - Create opportunities
   - My friend always says: If I don't have opportunities, I'll make them
   - Don't be afraid to mention who you are. When I applied for my last position of Python Developer, I also mentioned that I'd like to gain experience doing webinars or trainings. And I offered my services for free. If I didn't mention that, the door would be closed. They were thrilled from my pitch.
 - Learn public speaking skills
   - My activity in Toastmasters shows its fruits now
   - I know how to present myself, and how to show competence and confidence
   - I know how to talk to the camera
   - Feel free to visit any local Toastmasters club. I'll leave information below this video.
