# When things start to fit into places (Comenio Update #2)

## Hook
Hey guys, Vladim√≠r here with Comenio. Last time, I told you about our road so far. Today I'll tell you how we plan to build a healthy, sustainable company.

## Content
- Bootstraping
  - Building from our money
  - At least until we build an MVP; later we may approach investors
  - Total freedom; you answer only to yourselves
  - We need to think how to build a healthy company from the very start
  - We need to acquire customers while building our company. Influx of new customers needs to reflect the expansion of the company.
- MVP
  - We planned to run Open edX in isolated environments, so that each instructor is fully independant
  - Also, our service would run on a custom domain
  - Not manageable, if you're a small team of two
  - MVP had to be stripped-down
    - One common platform for everyone hosted at Comenio.org
    - Each instructor belongs into a different organization
    - Pure edX install with minimum customization
    - Change of perspective: Instead of searching of a way how to be unique, take the approach used in blog sites. First, your domain has no value. Then you publish content and people start coming and reading. We need to attract a fraction of people from the Internet to be profitable. Our business model doesn't need to be totally unique
- How I planned to finance the company early?
  - I planned to build online courses focused on software development
  - The courses would attract people to Comenio
  - Some would buy my courses. I would use part of the money to finance Comenio
  - Some would certainly be instructors, who might consider putting their courses to my site
  - I planned to build my first course till the end of May 2021
- Pivot
  - One of my friend works on a webinar where he'll teach business English. I thought that he might consider making a course too, and host it at Comenio
  - Another my friend works on online courses, and is searching of a way how to provide content to his customers. He was considering WordPress. I pitched him Comenio instead
  - He needed a proper solution within two or three weeks. At least something. Payment processing was not critical. He can sell directly
  - So either we bring up Comenio within a couple of weeks, or we loose a customer
  - We decided to dedicate our time, and launch our platform
  - My courses are pending now. Serving my customers is a number one priority
  - First customers will be served for free. We get valuable feedback, and they'll attract traffic to our site
  - Comenio gets noticed over time. At least we hope

Next time, we'll take a look at technical challenges. Why we use Amazon Web Services, and what are our goals to have better control over our infrastructure? If you want to know more, consider subscribing.

Thanks and see you next time!
