## Getting traction
- Especially when you have 0 subscribers, you should consider shooting videos according to A.S.Q (Ask specific questions)
- YouTube search bar can give you ideas, what your niche is searching for
- Usually howto videos are a good start
- Take my most popular blog posts as well. The same principle.

## Key points
- Every video: Hook, content, call to action (CTA) / Question of the Day
- Right to the point
- Hey guys, Sean here with ThinkMediaTV (after intro); tell something about your brand, what kind of videos you do. CTA Consider subscribing.
- Consistent music on a background
- Cuts mitigated by zooming video in our out for the changed scene

## Consistency Strategies
1. Batching - shoot a bunch of videos all of once
  - 3 to 6, sometimes even 10 videos shot at once
  - This allows me to have like one shoot day in a week or month, and dedicate the rest of time to editing or writing scripts, etc.
2. Block time
  - Shooting videos always takes longer than you think it's going to take
  - Block 3, 6+ hours a day
  - This allow me to block my energy. If I know it's a shoot day, I can prepare
    - Go to bed early. Get some sleep. Bring some energy. The rule: if you want to be appear normal on camera, you need to double your energy.
3. Assistant
  - Many things can be delegated to someone else
  - Not relevant at this point

## Shoot Day Checklist
- Video - camera ready to go, batteries charged, SD cards cleaned off
- Audio
- Lighting
- Set
- Wardrobe - Rotate a couple of shirts so that it appears videos are shot on different days

## Shoot Day Process
1. Video Outline - all scripts printed on a clip board (like Toastmasters)
2. Shoot the Video
3. Shoot Thumbnail Photos - shoot a couple of thumbnails
4. Shoot B-Roll Video Clips
5. Shoot Social Media Content - separate photos

## How to get your first 1000 subscribers on YT
1. Start before you're ready and post your first 35 videos
2. Answer the Who/What Question - Who am I serving and what problem am I solving
  - Mistake: Selfish Content VS. Service Content. 90 percent of people are putting out selfish content
  - Think about your audience first
3. Skill Up and Study Successful Channels
4. Focus on Search Based Content & Answer Specific Questions
  - Mistkake: Making Content Nobody Wants to Watch or That Nobody is Searching For
5. Commit
  - Mistake: Dabbling
